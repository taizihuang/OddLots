    <div class="inline-newsletter-top"></div><p><strong>Like much of the world, China is trying to reduce its dependence on carbon-intensive energy sources, such as coal. However, as it stands right now, China uses more coal than anyone else by a large margin. And while it has a substantial stock of coal within its borders, it’s also a major importer of it. So whatever China does regarding coal policy, will have significant ramifications for the whole world. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-31/china-is-changing-its-coal-use-and-it-affects-the-whole-world?sref=vuYGislZ" target="_blank"><meta content="R6KH0CT1UM14"/> <meta content="StoryLink"/>On this episode</a>, we speak with Alex Turnbull,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06357" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><meta content="WebLink"/> the co- author of a recent paper on Chinese coal usage</a>, to discuss the country’s domestic policy aims, as well as how any changes are already affecting the economy elsewhere.</strong></p>

</div><p><strong>Tracy Alloway: </strong><br/>Hello and welcome to another episode of the odd lots podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway<br/><br/><strong>Joe Weisenthal:</strong><br/>And I'm Joe Weisenthal.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So Joe, we've been talking quite a bit about supply chains.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>That's correct. For now, like pretty much like, well over a year, but yes, absolutely. Yeah. It's not going away.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>Yeah. That's probably an understatement. So one of the things we have definitely learned over the past year or so is that when one part of the global supply chain, I guess flaps its wings or experiences a disruption or whatever, it tends to ripple through a bunch of other things. And I think that's arguably what we've seen with energy prices and with the big surge in prices over the past few months. <br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>I think with commodities you can't delink them from global industrial per processes and supply chains in general. Like, it feels like when we talk commodities that it's like a, there is a very high level of demand, the GDP around the world growing very fast, particularly as economies return to trend or in some cases maybe even overshoot the previous trend. And then there is also these sort of idiosyncratic factors that pop up that are not really macro. Maybe it's related to weather, maybe it's related to environmental changes that inhibit production, maybe it's something else. And it's like that policy. So it's like that combination of very tight, very strong demand you then any ripple or any speed bump anywhere or any change on the supply side really gets magnified. Yeah.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So this was something that Jeff Curry at Goldman Sachs brought up on one of our episodes last year when we were discussing high energy prices and the commodities rally. He, I think he said that actually, what was happening in European gas actually began with the coal shortage in china. So there wasn't enough coal in China and they had to find a substitute energy source and what they found was oil and gas and that eventually fed through into European prices. So I guess what I'm saying is if you think of China coal as ground zero for higher energy prices that rippled throughout the world, it seems like we should dig into that.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Yes. I'm very curious. What's going on with China and energy, cuz there's lots of different things happening at once. There's the Olympics coming up, there's domestic policy changes, which we've talked about quite a bit, there's long term goals on changing the energy mix. I don't feel like I have much insight into it other than that is extremely important beyond China's borders. So yes, we need to dig in further.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>Okay. Well, I am pleased to say that we are going to do exactly that we have Alex Turnbull, a fund manager based in Singapore and someone who has done quite a bit of research into China's coal market. So Alex, welcome to the show.<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Thank you very much.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So I guess my first question, just to lay the groundwork for this discussion, one of the unusual things about the China coal market, as I understand it is that China does actually have a decent amount of coal within its borders, but it also imports a lot of its coal supplies. So I guess my question is why does that happen? Why do they do that? Why not just dig up what they have already?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Sure. With any commodity, which is reasonably low dollar value per ton, it's best to think of it as not a price where if you wanna buy an ounce of gold from someone it's sufficiently high value, they can mail it to you or export it quite easily with things that are relatively low value per ton, transport costs are incredibly important and location or constraints oh, are very important. So it's a little bit like gas pipelines where just cuz someone wants to buy gas somewhere doesn't mean you can actually deliver it to them or deliver it to them at an economical price. So with coal it's really these locational dynamics that make it quite a quirky market in some respects.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Just like 90 seconds into this discussion I'm or already finding that to be like very useful. So I wanna step back and ask a even zoom out even further before we get into the details. But it's in your research like outside of China specifically, why is this a question or why is this a topic that interests you and why should say anyone outside of China care that much.<br/><br/><strong>Alex</strong>:<br/>Sure. So my background is in distressed debt historically and, and convertible bonds and the coal sector repeatedly blew up over the course of,  the financial crisis. A few names got into trouble. There was a large protracted down on turn in 2015, 2016. And over that period, 2015, 16, 17, I simultaneously worked on Peabody energy, which went bankrupt and also Mongolian mining, which also went bankrupt around the same time, well had to be restructured. And so by seeing how those two business were actually quite tightly, coupled in weird ways via the Chinese coal market and the quirks within the Chinese coal market and regulatory actions there over time, this is essentially the biggest energy market in the world. It's almost a quarter of the world's carbon emissions, just coal and China, and it's recently poorly covered and understood. So in the course of tweeting about this in I think it was mid 2020, I got a reply back from a friend. Who's a professor at the Australian national university who said, what's all this about. And then we, we spoke about it for an hour or so. He said, why don't we do a paper about this? And I thought, well, let's, we can probably get the data or at least we can try. And so hence we went through this exercise of modeling the entire Chinese logistics power and steel market transport and the mines and the imports and a big simulation.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So maybe we should get into what has actually been happening with the coal market in China. And you know, I'm looking at a chart of prices and there was that spike late last year, sort of at the beginning of the fourth quarter, I guess. And it started coming down since then. So what exactly happened, I guess, what was the shock to China's coal system that set that price action in motion, this price volatility?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>So in thermal coal, you had a similar problem to a lot of other commodities and 2020 where demand collapsed. There was supply continued and while coal didn’t get negative prices like oil, it was pretty egregiously oversupplied. At the same time, there were weather dynamics. So in the Chinese power market, the second biggest source of power is hydro electric power. So if you get a lot of rain or a very wet summer and, um, spring in China, you then suddenly have a lot of cheap hydro power, which then displaces coal. So by Q4 2020, they were just about giving it away. But then there was a cold winter. And then over the course of say March to May, one key coal mine in province, massively under produced. So the tune of, you know, output was down 30% and at the same time demand was recovering like a, a lot of other places in the world.<br/><br/>You had a real upswing in power demand. And then by September 2021, there were in this, I think in Guangdong on the date that we have, they had less than six or seven days of coal inventory, to burn. So if there was a Typhon that came through Hong Kong and the ports got shot for a couple days that would've been lights out and going on and prices of course were flying at that point. Then the government stepped in, told everyone to turn the mines back on in Mongolia and now looks quite well supplied again, but it's been quite a rollercoaster, I would say.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>In general, what is the mix look in terms of how much coal it powers the Chinese economy, how much is domestic versus imported? And then also like what is the goal? Because China aspires to like many other countries reduce its use of coal for environmental reasons and so forth. Like what are the ambitions?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>So China is, is the world's biggest coal consumer by quite a large margin, but consumes about three and a half billion tons per year. Thermal coal, 2 billion tons goes into power. The rest goes into a bunch of industries, cement and so forth. And they import in general for thermal coal somewhere between 200 and 300 million tons a year, but that can be quite volatile. And most of that is imported into Southern provinces like Guandongwhich don't have their own coal mines and which are actually quite a long way from where China's are, you know, in the interior of the country, in Shahi and in Mongolia. And so China's currently trying to achieve two major objectives. One is to have a stable energy supply and some semblance of order within its power market, which is entirely understandable and also reduce its carbon emissions, which is also very understandable. But the question is given most of its coal, actually goes into either directly or indirectly into heavy industry, which is very heavily driven by real estate demand. Can they manage a real estate slow down or, or a change in growth model? So if you think about it, they carbon objectives, their energy security objectives and their financial rebalance and objectives are all these incredibly tightly coupled systems. And they're, they're kind of the same system in many regards when you do the carbon account.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>That's really interesting. So one thing I was wondering just on the policy front, so we did see China shut down quite a few more and specifically the older dirtier mines, I guess, how easy are those to turn back on or how flexible is new supply in terms of bringing additional capacity on stream?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>So well, when they initially had a big clean out of the sector in 2015, 16, they did shut down a lot of smaller private miners, which had a reputation for not being very compliant with safety standards or being well capitalized. Then coal prices got a bit high and in 2018, 19, they increased their CapEx coal mining, and they told the largest players to build bigger, more efficient, more mechanized mines. And so when things slowed down in Q2 of 21 that happened quite abruptly and it was quite a surprise to market participants. No one could really explain why that was happening as demand was going up. So it subsequently emerged later, but then it was actually very easy to turn that all back on, cause they were all very centralized data and enterprises. So it was sent as they put the memo out for everyone to mine more, get that on trains and get it out. You saw daily coal output explode. They actually had quite a lot of control when push came to show up on the market.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>I'm sorry, can you go back and maybe talk a little bit further about the way these various policy priorities dovetail with each other. And we actually just did an episode on the real estate sector and the attempt to transition some of the quality of GDP growth in China, away from real estate speculation and real estate development. And then the broader decarbonization. Can you talk a little bit about the common thread there and how coal itself sort of fits into all of it?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>So most of China's energy demand at least electrical power demand actually comes from heavy industries. And the biggest heavy industries are in order of appearance are ferrous metals, which is basically steel, non first metals. So things like copper and zinc and aluminum and then petrochemicals, and then cement, when you do the flow of materials. So you track, where does all the steel go actually very heavily goes into construction. Where do the emissions from steel come from? It's all electrical power and, and coal for smelting steel. You see that essentially the Chinese real estate sector accounts for in the order of say 40% of China's total emissions depends on whose accountant you're looking at, but it's, it's enormous. So, and then a heavy industry and that's just residential and that's commercial and the rest of it. And so heavy industry accounts for 67% on I think the latest data of China's power demand.<br/><br/>So, and then Chinese domestic construction in general is what drives China's emissions more than anything else. Essentially, if you are, if you want to reduce your carbon emissions and improve your energy security, by importing less coal, you can build less apartments. You can build a lot of renewables to replace the coal or a bit of both, but these things, these, these two functions are very tightly integrated. You know, it's always been an observation when people do modeling that if China were to get real estate construction rate more in line with global norms, it would be very easy for China to achieve quite remarkable carbon targets, but it's proven very hard for China to change its growth model and move from a, essentially an over construction paradigm in real estate and certainly residential real estate.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So I mean, assuming that China is at some point able to make some progress in changing the mix of its growth. And we do see house prices start to come down. What we've already seen, Chinese house prices start to come down and maybe housing inventory starts to be cut and we don't get as much construction of new homes. Assuming all of that happens, what happens in the energy space in terms of funding and capital is capital going to be an issue for Chinese energy or does all of that come from the state?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>It's very heavily state owned. So they essentially have access to if government policy is that they are to build certain things, then they'll be capital available for them to build certain things is the best way to think about it. It's not like the NDRC signs off on every single item on the CapEx plans, but there's a unity of vision there.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>I would say, let's go back to like the effect outside of China borders. And the other thing, you know, we've seen these sort of knock on effects. We've seen Sur energy prices in Europe. It's been a, you know, a very stressful winter, massive surge electricity bills, not only does that hit the household sector there, it's also hit some industrial sectors fertilizer companies shutting down or temporarily because it, it just doesn't make sense. They can't be run economically at these levels. We started this discussion talking about the ripple effects. And so what are the ripple effects from China and how do they relate to what we're seeing elsewhere in the world?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Sure. So the, the challenge for China is that if China has a shortage in energy, a province in, in Mongolia has an anti-corruption campaign and mine approvals don't happen, or there's some hold up in, in production. The problem is, is that if China needs to import a large amount of coal very quickly to short notice, it's very hard for China now to source that kind of volume of coal that it needs from the international market. The reason it is, is that China consumes, you know, 3 billion tons a year of sort of thermal between power cement and, um, heating. And then the US consumes 600. So it's like five times the size of the United States. And about the India's about the same, they're slightly smaller than the us. So it sort of swamps any viable supply that it might get from elsewhere if they had a significant shortage in China.<br/><br/>And so then what you saw in China was that as coal prices rose, there was switching from coal, you know, burning coal to get a lot of electricity to gas. So trying to started buying a lot of cargoes of L&amp;G and you saw that in the shipping data just exploded over the summer. And actually from May onwards when the inventory started to get low. And that of course tightened the gas markets at a time when Europe is normally built in inventories into winter and led to partners, one of the contributing factors to very tight gas markets over, um, this winter. So the problem is China's essentially, it's like having an adult on a trampoline with small children. It just is so big. Now it can kind of launch other markets without even trying to.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So what happens when China actually builds out its energy, independence or security, because this is something that we've seen explicitly as a policy goal, they want to reduce imports. They want to rely more on mining within their borders. What happens to that ripple effect if they manage to succeed in doing that, does that ripple effect start to come down? Or is it just so big that it's really difficult to reduce it?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>I think the, the challenge is, China burns about 6 million tons a day, six and a half million tons a day during winter, coal's got about the same density as water. So, you know, one given meter of water is a ton. And so you think of what that means in ship volumes. If you want to store that much coal, you know, you can literally see this from space happily and, and many commodity traders do. And so the problem is, is that China's now trying to enforce inventory levels on coal mines and power plants. And that can work up to a certain point, but realistically it will have to either gradually become slightly less energy intensive, significantly less energy intensive through changing growth model, all have to move to sources of power, which where it's a bit easy to manage your flow of energy.<br/><br/>So that's building a lot more renewables and having a lot more hydropower and, and pump hydro storage or a lot of nuclear. And from the latest plan, it looks like they'll be blend a lot of nuclear. And that will be actually in those coastal provinces, which are the big, you know, international coal imported provinces. So Ang, um, Fuer and . So I think over time they will, they will essentially exit coal markets. So that is certainly their intent and become more self-sufficient. But I don't think it's, I think trying to manage these, I inventories to try to stay very heavily fossil oriented when they accidentally consuming this much is very challenging.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>You know, I'm thinking one of the storylines out of Europe, and again, probably need to talk about it more, especially cuz it has long term Rama for the energy transition is like this perception that Europe has tried to transition to renewables maybe too fast in the case of Germany still shutting down nuclear, not maintaining like a robust base load, even as it, uh, transitions does, China's attempt to transition long, are off call. And you mentioned that it's going to be investing more in nuclear. Is that going to allow it to achieve those goals, achieve the decarbonization goals while also not running into short term volatility, not running into a mismatch and is nuclear an important part of, of making a transition sustainable?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>I think is very important for those Southern provinces where you don't have great solar resources or that particularly good wind resources. So you're, you're sort of out to two on that, on that count limited hydro and you wanna reduce your coal import. There's not really by process of elimination. That's, that's probably the way they'll go and that's certainly what's coming outta their energy clients. I think for Europe there, there's a, it's sort of the, what the problem with power price variation is not day to day, it's this seasonal storage. So it's how do you store up the energy you need for winter in the, in summer? And normally you do that through a, you know, hydro power or through just, you know, store running your gas storage up to, you know, 90% and then running it down to 50% as they do normally in Europe, around February and month.<br/><br/>But if you have China lifting of the spot elementary cargos for their own reasons, and then Putin has other plans, then that kind of runs into trouble. So it's not the variability of renewables tends to be like, you're not sure whether it's gonna be on or off any you given one hour period, but over the course of a week, it's, you know, reasonably predictable, especially if it's a blend of solar wind, but what you can't really hedge is how do you, how do you build up massive storage over the summer and then kick it for winter? Like a squirrel basically.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So can I ask a really basic question on the renewable energy front, which is there was always suspicion about how serious to China actually is when it comes to decarbonization, as in, is it actually going to meet the quite lofty goals that it's set out for itself? And so I guess my question is one, how serious are they on the green energy front and decarbonization and two, why decarbonization at all? Why is it important to them? Is it genuinely a climate concern or is it more about efficiency and building out that self-sufficiency when it comes to energy security?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Well, I think historically the power regulations until quite recently were not particularly coherent. And I would say the incentives for utilities to take renewable power, like in 2016, the, the level of curtailment, essentially wind farms have produced power and then not be able to sell to the market was very high. And there were a lot of market design issues. I think what they've done recently is they fixed a lot. A lot of those issues, there are, there are still some but more importantly, they seem to be looking to fix coal prices significantly higher, so that renewables, they can be very competitive, you know, without any subsidies whatsoever and will be actually a preferred source of power dispatch. So I think the next couple of years are going to be, will quite, will surprise people how much they will build in terms of renewables because the market incentives now very strong.<br/><br/>Um, if you think simplistically, if there seems to be fixed coal contracts around 700 Rebi, so it's 110 us dollars plus minus there's about a third of a ton of coal that go to make a, you know, megawat hour of power. There are lots and lots of renewable projects which can make money well below, you know, $30 in China. And that'll that's so essentially if you're a coal plant, you can't even cover a fuel costs for that kind of competition. So I think they have started to get the market design right in, in all fairness, um, in terms of their motivations. I think a lot of this is driven by I guess, a more tough outlook on their foreign policy and security environment. And there are realistic considerations that if you need to import know a couple hundred million tons into your coastal provinces and you can't build in batteries more than 30 days there, and you have a Marine conflict in your local neighborhood and you can't get merchant Marine through, then your power grid goes down in less than a month. That's obviously something they can't really tolerate given some of their ambitions in the Marine. So I think there is a strong security angle to some of their new religion around decarbonization. So<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Who loses big picture as the decarbonization effort continue and make serious progress and greater production of renewables and, or  nuclear domestically who ultimately loses out from that shift?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Sure. I mean, right now there's part of the reason the coal market's so strong is due to a lot of supply interruptions in Indonesia. Um, and China also had to buy a lot of coal influence very quickly at the end of last year, longer term. It's very bad for the major coal exporters, which are to China, which are Indonesia, principally Australia, which does not. China has banned from exporting coal to them due to diplomatic frackers and so forth. They will be major losers from the shrunken, um, thermal coal market and Seaborn shipping, but for met coal, which goes into, which is a, a different sort of thing. It really will be the big loser there, but also Russia and the us. And I mean, the only reason the met coal market is very strong right now is cuz China was buying. Most of its met coal from Mongolia in 2019, but due to, um, closing the border due to COVID giving it substantially closed, that's led to this explosion of coal exports from Russia and Canada and the us to China to replace the fact that they kicked out Australia. They closed the border with Mongolia and they're having to buy very expensive coal from a very long way away. Now<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>You mentioned incentives and the idea that energy producers are very much devised to shift to renewables in the current market. But one thing we saw last year when coal prices were actually spiking was China liberalized its market. And I think it said it would allow prices to rise something like 20% in order to incentivize more power production. And I think it was something like 10% before. So I'm wondering how significant is that shift? Is that a permanent liberalization of the market in order to encourage more energy production? Or is it more of a one time thing to try to balance out the market? It immediately,<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Well, what happened was in September that the coal price got so high, I think it got one point got to a futures in ju got to like 2000 ton plus the power plants, which were obliged to produce, but could not get prices above a certain level and cover their fuel costs just said, oops, I to do some plan maintenance or, oh no, someone turned off the machines. And so you had these roll in blackouts cause the utilities were just selecting to, you know, not produce at loss. And so they've made all these adjustments to maximum coal price and then fuel cost pass through to enable the market to function again. And that seems to be working, you know, okay, now there's a reasonably wide band. So it's 20% either side and under normal circumstances, that should be more adequate to ensure that people are reasonably price signals. But yeah, there was just absolute money in September, October.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>I mentioned this at the beginning, I just out of curiosity, has the re has, has short term policy been affected by the upcoming Olympics. And I know there's always talk about, you know, blue skies and the goal of having good air quality ahead of big events is that affecting current market conditions at all.<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>So there's two ways to make steel. One is with a, a blast funds where you use a lot of Coke, coal and, um, and use thermal cold. The, the heat and the other way is with electric arch furnace, where you just use co coal and electric and electric arch furnaces are generally smaller, less noisy and make less emissions. And so for example, before the Olympics, they've been telling everyone to stop up stock up their thermal coals so they can produce the electric power to run the electric arch bonuses. And for absolutely everyone to take maintenance stays off, not use blast oxygen furnaces to get, you know, to have blue skies and so forth. And I think there's gonna be extended time off the factories around, uh Herba, which is sort of the problems that surrounds, um, Beijing to ensure that they have the, you know, scenery and background. It's not, not the first time I've done it. I sold them do it in 2008. I'll do it again this time. It's, it's, it's somewhat predictable.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So we started this conversation talking about the supply chain of energy and the idea that one disruption in China can have a knock on effect to European prices. So I'm wondering, we've already seen Chinese or we've already seen prices for China coals start to come down and you talk about some projects to build up capacity specifically that big mine in Mongolia, and a lot of the, of the renewable projects, at what point does capacity get built out enough that it starts to ripple back through the European market and prices start to come down there?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Well it's interesting. I mean, just recently, and I think we're, we're speaking towards the end of January, China's already turned around and said they will start selling L&amp;G cargos back into the market. And that's already taking down European gas prices and the relevant spot and swap markets quite sharply, um, over the last couple days. We'll probably continue to do so. So that's already happening. Like seaboard, thermal markets are still reasonably tight due to disruptions in Indonesia, which is ironically due to intensified rainfall from since be climate change driven. So I think we'll start to see things normalize as we get toward the end of the year. China will have very high entries. There will not be aggressive buyers of sea on coal and Indonesia, I assume, will have slightly more normal weather patterns as, than in your weekends. And then they'll be able to produce more. So there's this sort of driver of the energy, this sort of this energy super spike does seem to be settling down quite sharply.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Is this the, is the super spike that we've seen this year in Europe or is this sort of, you know, as you said, was it kind of a one off fluke or is this something that due to structural factors that will take a while to ameliorate could see, um, a recurring winter phenomenon going forward?<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>I think this was, this was a one off. I doubt China will have issues. Don’t think the coal market will be quite as acute as last year year they had last year because it was tied up with, you know, anti-corruption campaigns, right? Inspections and a bunch of things which are not market driven, I would say, um, but to impact markets. So I don't think that will occur again. They do appear to be having more coherent policies around what IOUs people should hold, that you don't get situations where things get that desperate again. Um, and then they have partially liberalize their power markets, which should give better long term signals. So I think China's less likely to be a ground zero for large shocks that propagate out through energy markets. On the other hand, it's so big that even minor shocks in China can feel very big on elsewhere, especially if markets are, are generally taught otherwise.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>One thing, or let me just think how to phrase this. So I saw you tweeting late last year, and this was still when coal prices were spiking quite a bit. And you are basically saying everyone is about to get shocked because prices are going to start coming down very soon. What was it that you were seeing in the market that perhaps others weren't seeing at that time, because you did turn out to be right. And of course we have seen coal prices ease since then.<br/><br/><strong>Alex: </strong><br/>There's a lot of very niche data you can get is from Chinese railways and so forth. So you can get data on how much coal is being loaded in these large railhead new minds in Mongolia and in Shai and Shai. And then you can sort of get, get the, the number of trains loaded and can start to see the it's like a tie away. You can sort of start to see the, you know, the, the water sucking back from the beach before it kind of gets blows way that that's what you can see. And you can, you can get that a daily frequency. So once that supply response really started to happen at the mines, and then they started to essentially suck all the rail cars out from Chinese ports, Northern ports, up to the mines. You knew something was coming and you normally, when the Chinese government puts out all points bulletin to make something happen, it's normally pretty safe, but it will happen unless the short term . But, but the size of the response I think was quite surprising to a lot of people.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Obviously like higher commodity prices, higher energy prices, inflation or higher transport costs has inflation more broadly around the world. Like it does feel like there's a lot of temporary or transitory factors driving it. I know we're not like supposed to use that word anymore. And I know that that there's more to life than like what's happening in the Chinese coal market. But when you think about like how, you know, the idiosyncratic factors happening in the Chinese coal market, the way that, and I loved your analogy of a large adult jumping on a trampoline with a bunch of little kids, the way that filtered into European prices, the way that European energy prices have filtered into fertilizer prices, the way fertilizer prices feed into food prices and so forth, it's hard. Like not to sort of feel like, yeah, there really are a lot of transitory factors. I don't know whether like inflation will totally normal, but a bunch of weird stuff has gone on.<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>I think so, but I think one thing that's also interest with, with Cole and China in particular, when they, the prices got off to, you know, 2000 renminbi per r ton for thermal, which was just absolutely bananas. But then what was quite shocking to people is China came out and said, no, we want a long term target contract price of, you know, 700 RMB per ton, which people were shocked by. Cause cause you know, pre COVID 550. And I think what, what China's doing there, which is quite shrewd is that in all the craziness and inflationary impulses of all these disruptions, China's using this opportunity to force a repricing of fossil energy in China through to industry. And that has big impacts cuz when you smelt a ton of aluminum you need about 11 megawat hours do that. And so that's, you know, 11 times 150, you know, it's like pushing up the price of aluminum 50 bucks, they're sort of pushing through these kind of policy driven repricing, because they do want to speed this, you know, carbon transition and change, uh, incentives around, um, consumption of very energy intensive products to a certain extent.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they've got, they've got the social stability and the maintaining sort of, you know, employment or the other they have, but there is a sign that they're kind of going to take a bit more pain than they were last time on some of these cost changes.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>So, there are some fundamental changes here and you know, there's sort of China putting a bit of a floor under the price of coal and therefore the under the price of other commodity production that are not just going to who revert to pre COVID levels, sort of a defacto or an implicit like carbon tax, the way economists in Europe and the us propose. And,<br/><br/><strong>Alex</strong>:<br/>And you are saying that comfort, like you talk to companies like Shenhua , which is like China's biggest coal miner. When I asked them in 2016, I said, you know, you guys can try to go under renewables or something. Say, “why would I do that? You know, I'm never get paid my subsidies on time. It's a terrible business. And you know, no thank you.” And now that they just announced, they're going to give renewable. So essentially the, the policy signals and these sort of will of the party state is to get things done in this area. Now whether they can tolerate slow down in real estate, other considerations in is right to be seen. But in other ways, this is, there are signs of a bit more serious than, um, they've been in quite some time.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy</strong>:<br/>All right, Alex, that was a fantastic discussion and a really good Roundup of what's going on in the space and drawing the connections between China and Europe. So thank you so much for coming on our bots.<br/><br/><strong>Alex:</strong><br/>Cool. Thank you so much guys. Really enjoyed it.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>That was great. Thanks Alex.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>So Joe, I obviously thought that was a very interesting conversation. One of the things that struck me was I think energy might be one of the few places where there's actually policy agreement between China and Europe. So Europe wants energy prices to come down. China wants to build out its energy efficiency and self-sufficiency, and sort of going back to that trampoline analogy, you know, the kids want the adult to get their own trampoline, I guess. And, the adult wants their own trampoline too. So, you know, if both of those parties are aligned, it seems like at some point that could happen.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>One thing that I've always liked about Alex's work and research and just following his stuff and talking to him over many years is the granular level of detail that he knows about all these different industrial processes, whether it's like how much it costs to make steel to the various the electricity budget for steel or aluminum. And obviously he talked about how he was able to sort of anticipate the moving coal by looking at railroad loadings. There's a mu uh, a deep granularity, I guess like if, you know, you talk about, if you're going to be working in the business of buying of distressed assets of industrial or commodity related companies, you really have to know like nuts and bolts, what the value and what the potential recovery, you know, I guess I would say to understand recovery values of these assets, you really have to know like the various like input costs of what you can get out of them.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>Yeah. It definitely seems like that's the case. The, the other thing that I was thinking about is I guess, all eyes on Mongolia and China relations for the foreseeable future, because it also seems like that's a dynamic where it does have the potential to impact the energy space quite significantly.<br/><br/><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Absolutely. But, and, and I'm really glad, like the point that he made at the end, it's like, okay, so cold price is, is, went nuts. And obviously, China needed to make changes to address that. But the idea that like, they really don't want to, or at least at the moment, they don't want to go back to the pre crisis dirt cheap prices and that this is an opportunity for transition. And so setting this floor is really interesting. And I definitely think listeners, hopefully if they haven't need to go back and listen to the episode that we just recorded with Travis Lundy because I hadn't thought about that really at all of, although of course it makes sense that it's part and parcel of the same thing. Like there's if you want to have a more sustain energy budget, part of it might involve changing the pace of real estate development.<br/><br/><strong>Tracy:</strong><br/>Yeah. It's interesting how those two seem to fit together. And you're right. I hadn't thought about that before. No, in any case lots going on in China and the Chinese economy, should we leave it there? </p><div class="for-you__wrapper paywall"></div><p class="paywall"><strong>Joe:</strong><br/>Let’s leave it there.</p><ol class="noscript-footnotes paywall"></ol><div class="inline-newsletter-bottom paywall"></div></body></html>
