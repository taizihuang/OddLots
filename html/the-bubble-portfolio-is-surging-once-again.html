    <html><body><div class="inline-newsletter-top"></div><p>A hypothetical portfolio of frothy assets is surging once again after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-10/the-bubble-portfolio-is-getting-absolutely-crushed" target="_blank"> <meta content="RBO8VJT1UM13"/> <meta content="StoryLink"/>getting absolutely smashed last year</a>.</p><p>The portfolio was crushed last year as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates at the fastest pace in decades, but it seems in 2023 you can’t quite keep a good bubble down. Investors are piling into assets that were once among the least-loved, driving the bubbleicious basket to a year-to-date return of almost 30% That compares with a 14% in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p class="paywall">“It really does look like the worse the asset, the better the performance,” said Paul McNamara, the GAM UK fund manager who created the bubble portfolio. “The best performer is Tesla, currently ranked as 28th out of the 32 car brands, according to estimates from JD Power. Second is Bitcoin after a year when crypto currencies have become synonymous with scams.”</p><p class="paywall">“I wish I’d bought the bubble instead of pursuing my day job,” he added.</p><figure align="center" class="figure-expandable paywall" data-align="center" data-id="399277567" data-image-size="column" data-image-type="photo" data-type="image" style="max-width: 1200px;"><div aria-label="Open image in viewer" class="image" role="button" tabindex="0"><div class="lazy-img" id="lazy-img-399277567"><style>#lazy-img-399277567:before{padding-top:56.25%;}</style><img alt="Forever Blowing Bubbles | A hypothetical portfolio of bubbly stocks has surged this year" class="lazy-img__image" data-img-type="photo" data-native-src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWu8HmO.L38U/v1/-1x-1.png" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWu8HmO.L38U/v1/60x-1.png"/></div></div></figure><div class="for-you__wrapper paywall"></div><p class="paywall">Created by McNamara back in 2017, the index was designed to group together assets where the consensus was that they were on an unsustainable tear. It was stuffed with everything from tech stocks to cryptocurrency to high duration bonds.</p>

<p class="paywall">If you drill down into some of the portfolio’s holdings, you can see what’s driving the outperformance:</p><ul class="paywall"> <li><strong>Tesla  Inc.: </strong>The share price of this company with a sometimes cult-like following is up 110%.</li> <li><strong>Bitcoin: </strong>The cryptocurrency is up about 57% this year despite multiple scandals in the space.</li> <li><strong>Netflix Inc.: </strong>The streaming service has surged 48% after cracking down on password sharing.</li> <li><strong>Tencent Holdings Ltd.:</strong> The Chinese tech giant is up almost 9%.</li></ul><p class="paywall">Still, the portfolio does bear some scars. Holdings such as the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (or XIV) were marked to zero after the exchange-traded note <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-07/how-two-tiny-volatility-products-helped-fuel-sudden-stock-slump" target="_blank">evaporated in the ‘Volmageddon’ of early 2018</a>. Meanwhile, Argentina’s hundred-year bonds due in 2117 were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-debt/argentinas-old-bonds-wave-goodbye-as-focus-turns-to-new-debt-idUSKBN25V2LQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restructured</a> just a few years after being sold. </p><p class="paywall">Nevertheless, the apparent resurgence in animal spirits could turn into a headache for the Federal Reserve, which may be on guard against loosening financial conditions as it attempts to stamp out above-target inflation. Investors now widely expect the the central bank to avoid another hike at its meeting today, which seems to once again be green light for more speculative activity.</p><ol class="noscript-footnotes paywall"></ol><div class="inline-newsletter-bottom paywall"></div></body></html></body></html>
