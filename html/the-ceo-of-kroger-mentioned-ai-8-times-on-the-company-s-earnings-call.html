Good morning. So, this isn't the first-quarter you've talked about making price investments, it seems like it stepped-up a bit. The tone is a little more elevated is that right. And it seems like that's in response to the competitive environment. I'm curious if it's something sustainable you're seeing this as a onetime, how should we read this and is this or is this a permanent change that you think will be persistent for the time-being.</p><p>Rodney McMullen:</p><p>I wouldn't read it a little different than the way you asked the questions then in if you look, it's really broad-based. But it's we continue to get better on using our own algorithms and <strong>AI </strong>to make sure that we're offering promotions that are most attractive to customers. By households so some of that it increased engagement is being able to do a better job targeting, as I mentioned Chuck on the CPGs a significant portion of that. It's funded by CPGs which we think it's good for our customers and obviously good for tonnage overtime.</p></blockquote><p class="paywall">It’s worth noting that in its last earnings call, in March, AI came up zero times. All that said, it looks like investors aren’t treating Kroger as an AI stock. Shares are down 3% today.</p><ol class="noscript-footnotes paywall"></ol><div class="inline-newsletter-bottom paywall"></div></body></html></body></html>
