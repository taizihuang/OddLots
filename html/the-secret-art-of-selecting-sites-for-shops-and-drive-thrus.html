        <h2>The Secret Art of Selecting Sites for Shops and Drive-Thrus</h2>
    <p>  <br><b>We know that companies think carefully about where they open stores. They might look at things like how many people pass by the location on a day-to-day basis or how easy it is to access the site by car. But what are the lesser known factors that go into deciding where to open a brick-and-mortar store? And how have these considerations changed over time? In this episode, we talk about the art of retail site selection. We speak with Tom McGee, CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which annually hosts one of the biggest deal-making events connecting retailers and commercial real estate owners. Then, we drill down into a specific type of business: drive-thrus for coffee chains and fast food restaurants. We speak with Chris Hatch, partner at Forza Development.

I'm Tracy Alloway.</p><p><b>Joe (00:15):</b><br>And I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p><b>Tracy (00:17):</b><br>Joe, do you remember   our conversation with Alli Webb, the founder of Drybar?</p><p><b>Joe (00:22):</b><br>Yes. That was a really great conversation and we talked a little bit about how she selected optimal Drybar locations. I think both of our interests were piqued at that exact moment about the art of location selection. </p><p><b>Tracy (00:35):</b><br>It was sort of a light bulb moment for me because obviously you think, yes, if you're a business, you're putting a lot of thought into where you're opening up a store. And presumably you want to find a location with lots of traffic and try to sell as much as you possibly can. But there are all these new and intriguing factors that were sort of lurking behind the scenes.</p><p>So I remember Alli was talking about how for Drybar, it's really important that you select a location where you can effectively slot into a customer's sort of day-to-day routine — next to a grocery store, or on the outside of a shopping mall so that there's easy access. But there were also things that I had never considered, like if you are in a shopping mall, does the shopping mall owner actually allow more than one hair salon in that space?</p><p><b>Joe (01:29):</b><br>Speaking of shopping centers, there's this location that I drive past sometimes when I'm on the Long Island Expressway, and in this one shopping center that I always see from the highway, there is a Drybar, a SoulCycle, and something else. And I just imagine that's perfect for the person, most likely a woman in this case, this shopping center basically knocks out three of the things that they have to get taken care of during some two hour block of free time that they have.</p><p><b>Tracy (02:01):</b><br>Man, that is a lifestyle right there.</p><p><b>Joe (02:03):</b><br>Yes, it's a lifestyle location for sure.</p><p><b>Tracy (02:06):</b><br>But the point is, there are all these hidden things happening behind brick-and-mortar site location, and I feel like we should get a better sense of them, particularly in the context of what's happening with commercial real estate. We've done a couple episodes on CRE and offices, but also on   shopping malls.</p><p>And again, there are things in the shopping mall world that I have never considered before, such as the maintenance, or how important are holiday decorations, and how that can feed into values and things. So I'm curious if you're a business, if you're thinking about, ‘Well, I want to open a store in this particular strip mall because they have really nice Christmas decorations,’ or something like that.</p><p><b>Joe (02:47):</b><br>Totally. Or where in store, or where in the strip mall the store physically is, the types of turns that you have to take could matter. All kinds of things. It's like, yes, we all know location matters, but there are real professionals and true location optimization... </p><p><b>Tracy (03:06):</b><br>Yeah, the secret art of choosing shop sites!</p><p><b>Joe (03:08):</b><br>Yeah, and so, we should, so I'm eager to learn more.</p><p><b>Tracy (03:12):</b><br>Okay. So this is actually a two-part episode. That means we have two perfect guests for you. To begin with we're going to be speaking a bit broadly about this whole idea of site location. We are going to talk with Tom McGee, he is the CEO of something I didn't know existed, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the ICSC, which is a trade association for shops. We're going to talk to him generally about how businesses choose where to set up shop, but then we have a second guest we're going to drill down into even more detail, Joe.</p><p><b>Joe (03:48):</b><br>That's right. After our conversation with Tom, we are speaking with Chris Hatch of Forza Development. His actual real expertise happens to be in drive-thru locations, so things like Starbucks drive-thrus and In-N-Out drive-thrus. And so after our sort of general conversation with Tom, we're going to be speaking with a specialist in one area about how a national chain figures out the optimal spot to put in a drive-thru location.</p><p><b>Tracy (04:16):</b><br>Alright. Here is our conversation with Tom McGee, the CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers. Tom, what is the International Council of Shopping Centers?</p><p><b>Tom McGee (04:26):</b><br>Well, the International Council of Shopping Centers – which we go by the term ICSC – is a trade association. We represent about 55,000 members, landlords, owner developers, tenants, service providers, brokers, accountants, attorneys, everyone that serves the retail industry with a particular focus upon physical retail.</p><p><b>Joe (04:49):</b><br>So big picture, some sort of national chain, you know, like a Tractor Supply or a Starbucks – they're like ‘Okay, we want to expand in a new area.’ What is the process generally by which they'd go out? Do companies have like in-house real estate teams, is it brokers? Walk through the process by which a commercial landlord and some sort of retailer will connect typically? </p><p><b>Tom (05:13):</b><br>Well, you touched upon a couple things, and those are two very different brands, but first, most big national retailers will have an in-house real estate team. That does not mean that they won't use brokers for assistance. And certainly all national owner-developers will have an in-house leasing team, people that work with tenants to help them find space and negotiate terms.</p><p>But big picture, the CEO will start and say ‘We have growth objectives. You know, we want to open up a certain number of stores this year to help meet those objectives, and/or, we have a number of leases that are coming due and we may want to renew those leases or look for alternative sites.’</p><p>And so what they'll start with is based upon those two broad objectives, say, ‘Okay, first of all, who's our core customer?’ Particularly if you're an established retailer, you have a pretty good sense of who your core customer is and who you want to serve and who you want to establish. And so demographics are very, very important. You look at different trade areas and you say, ‘Okay, does this particular trade area have the demographics, the type of customer that we're looking to serve?’</p><p>If you are a Tractor Supply, you have a certain demographic that's probably interested in the type of products that you serve. If you have a Tiffany's, you have a certain demographic of the type of customer that you're trying to serve. And you're looking for those different types of locations or areas that fit your customer needs. And then you start looking at, okay, what other retailers are there? What are the properties that are available that I might want to situate in?</p><p>And generally the vast majority of retail in the United States — New York being an obvious exception where there's a lot of street retail and so forth — are domiciled in shopping centers, whether that's big regional malls or local open air shopping centers and everything in between. And then they'll start looking at the different types of properties that they want to locate their space in and begin to talk to landlords and begin to understand who the other tenants within that space are, etc.</p><p>They may use a broker to help them with that. They may not. A landlord may use a broker to help them. They may not. The larger they are, generally the more in-house it is, the smaller they are, generally the more they might use an outside service provider, but even large national chains and large national landlords will often use service providers to supplement their team.</p><p><b>Tracy (07:37):</b><br>What kind of due diligence goes into identifying locations? So let's say, I don't know, I have a small business and there's a nice strip mall and there's a vacant space, and I think this looks like a really good possibility for us to set up shop. What are the sort of factors or things that we would be looking out for? Like for instance, would we be standing outside the shop, measuring footfall, or something like that?</p><p><b>Tom (08:02):</b><br>You would certainly stand outside the shopping center and want to observe it, and make sure that it's of a stature and a quality that's representative of your brand. I mean, you start out with demographics and looking at your customers, but then you start drilling down and you might have a shopping center on both sides of the street. And you might say, ‘Well, why do I pick this one versus a different one?’</p><p>And you might do research on social media and see what the local community says. You certainly are going to look at the upkeep of the shopping center. Is it visually appealing? Is it well-maintained? Who are the other tenants? That's a really big deal for retailers, because not only are they going to want to make sure that there's not a natural competitor that's in that space, that they might cannibalize each other, but you are the company you keep. So you are going to want to make sure that the folks that are in that center are consistent with your brand.</p><p>You're not going to generally have a Walmart, which is a large mass merchant retailer, next to a Ralph Lauren, or Louis Vuitton, which is a high-end luxury. So you want to make sure that there's a consistency to the type of retailer that's in that location. </p><p><b>Joe (09:11):</b><br>Well, I was going to say conversely, from the perspective of the shopping center, how much do they think like ‘Okay, here's a vape shop, here's a...’</p><p><b>Tracy (09:23):</b><br>Spencer Gifts. I imagine those must be co-located next to vape shops, if they still exist.</p><p><b>Joe (09:30):</b><br>Yeah, like how much do they think about mix optimization?</p><p><b>Tom (09:34):</b><br>You absolutely think about that, because first and foremost, the traffic that's in the shopping center is going to be driven by the tenants that are in the shopping center. So you want to have consistency. That's why you often see certain retailers that are in the same shopping center. You might see certain discount retailers  and certain service providers that are often in the same shopping center – Ulta and a Target and so forth, because they have a similar type of consumer.</p><p>So in your example, you probably, if you have a vape shop, you're probably not going to see certain retailers in there because that's not necessarily consistent with the demographics that they're looking for. Conversely, the shopping center owners themselves, it's really important to them as well to curate the mix appropriately. Because that's going to generate traffic. If you have a hodgepodge of stuff mixed in that doesn't have any synergy, that definitely isn't good for traffic.</p><p>That's not good for your brand, and ultimately it's not good for your ability to attract the next retailer, and the next retailer. Because this particular industry, retail real estate, more than any other form of real estate, is very relationship-driven, and people are concerned, for example, in an office, a law firm might be on the fifth floor, and a construction company might be on the sixth floor. It doesn't really matter. But in a shopping center, whether it's a big regional mall or it's a local shopping center, it does matter who's next door to you because there's a synergy and a relationship both from brand identity and also foot traffic. That's very, very important.</p><p><b>Tracy (11:11):</b><br>So let's say we've identified a likely location and we're now negotiating with the landlord about setting up a lease of some sort. What would go into those negotiations and what are the typical sticking points that you observe?</p><p><b>Tom (11:27):</b><br>Well, the most important ones are the most obvious ones, right? Term and price. So those are often, quite frankly, the most important. They're the most important points and often the sticking point, right? They’re the sticking points because both sides have a mutuality of interest to make sure they're being competitive. But outside of that, you're going to look at things like co-tenancy, who else is in the shopping center? And is there somebody that has a clause in there that says you can't have a similar type of apparel retailer?</p><p><b>Tracy (11:52):</b><br>Could I demand a co-tenancy clause? Like for my business, could I say I don't want any other competitors in this area if I take up the space?</p><p><b>Tom (12:00):</b><br>Yes, you could have co-tenancy clauses as a tenant, and that would be a negotiating point. You're not necessarily going to get it. But you can certainly request it. And your prominence, your leverage, the bigger you are and the more traffic you're going to drive, the more leverage you're going to have.</p><p>And now those tenancy clauses can often get renegotiated. So you have a co-tenancy clause, and the landlord might identify a tenant that they want in that shopping center. And they may go to that other tenant that has a good tenancy clause and say ‘Hey, we got this great retailer that we want to bring in. You have a co-tenancy clause that prohibits it, let's negotiate it.’ And that may be a negotiation. They might say ‘Hey, that's great, there might be no consideration, because they might look at it and say ‘That's going to drive more traffic.’ Or they might – there's a financial consideration, or a free rent period, or some type of negotiation that might take place to adjust that co-tenancy clause.</p><p><b>Joe (12:58):</b><br>So drilling down further, you know, we talked to Alli Webb, the founder of Drybar. And the other point that she made that I think really sort of hit a light bulb was that you can identify a great region or a great area, or a great town or demographic, you can identify the right shopping center, but depending on the nature of what you're selling, location in that center is important. So she pointed out that for a blowdry bar, where it's all about the in and out and [being] quick, if you're in a mall, you don't want to be deep in the mall and that that's problematic. You're not targeting people who plan to spend a lot of time in the mall. You want to be on the perimeter. What are some other, you know, okay, after you identify the shopping, etc., etc., what are the other types of things that you see retailers thinking about within the space?</p><p><b>Tom (13:43):</b><br>Well, that's a particularly important one, right? If you were a convenience type of retailer, you definitely want to be a place that's convenient, right? So you want to make sure you're on the end. You want to make it as easy and frictionless as possible for your customer.</p><p>Another big one, because of the nature of how physical retail is used today, which isn't just for traditional shopping — so we all picture that people go into retailers and shop and walk around the aisles and so forth, which in fact, they obviously do a lot of – but think about what happened during Covid. You have this whole convergence between the physical and digital world, you have things like curbside pickup and click and collect and so forth.</p><p>So now the actual parking lot and the flow of traffic right, is really, really important. If you're a retailer that really wants to, and this is a whole other topic, but if you're a retailer that really wants to drive as many people as possible to your store, because while you and I all believe it's a constitutional right to get free shipping...</p><p><b>Joe (14:40):</b><br>That's right. I do believe that.</p><p><b>Tom (14:42):</b><br>Somebody actually is paying for that. And it's the retailer. And so if they can drive someone to go to their store to pick up that good that they ordered online, that's a big win because they preserved that margin. But you're going to want to make sure that experience is very frictionless.</p><p>And so if I'm driving up and I did a click and collect, curbside pickup, well, I want to have somebody actually put it in my trunk very easily and I drive away, and/or I'm going to want to set up the store in such a way that if somebody's going to go do a click and collect and actually walk in the store, that they can do that in a very convenient way. So location matters. It depends upon what your strategy is and how you're going to use that store.</p><p><b>Tracy (15:36):</b><br>How scalable are these types of tenancy agreements? Like if I am a national chain, could I strike some sort of deal with a major shopping mall operator, or a major landlord of some sort, to set up shops in like 10 different states at multiple locations?</p><p><b>Tom (15:55):</b><br>You could, but it tends to be much more property specific than that. Because It goes back to kind of the basics of location. You really want to think about the demographics of that area, the community that you're serving and so forth. So yes, you could strike a large deal like that, but particularly on large national retailers who already have an established footprint, they're going to be much more location specific.</p><p><b>Tracy (16:20):</b><br>So the International Council of Shopping Centers, you actually run one of the big deal-making conferences for this space.</p><p><b>Tom (16:29):</b><br>Oh, we do. It goes back to this industry being very relationship-based. And so we host about a hundred different events annually. We have one exceptionally large event, which is in Las Vegas, in the third week of May. Every year, we call it ICSC Las Vegas. We'll have about 30,000 people come to that event.</p><p>And they come to that event for one reason: to do deals. Yes, we have content and a whole bunch of other aspects to it, but the core reason they're there is to network and talk transactions. So if you're a major, or quite frankly, even a regional landlord owner, developer, and you're a national, regional, or an emerging retailer that's looking to open up locations, you'll very likely go to that event, or one of our other hundred events, to build relationships and talk about expansion and talk about locations. And landlords will look at that as an opportunity to both nurture your existing relationships, but also attract those new tenants into their spaces.</p><p><b>Joe (17:32):</b><br>I know these conferences are really just about meeting people and deals, but I assume...</p><p><b>Tracy (17:37):</b><br>Also being in Las Vegas...</p><p><b>Joe (17:38):</b><br>And being in Las Vegas, which is why I would like to come. </p><p><b>Tom (17:41):</b><br>Well, we'd love to have you.</p><p><b>Joe (17:41):</b><br>We’ll come out. But I assume that there's a program and panels and stuff like that. What are going to be the big themes right now, in spring 2024, in terms of location identification?</p><p><b>Tom (17:53):</b><br>I mean, the biggest challenge the industry has right now, and this is going to surprise you, but it's really supply.</p><p><b>Joe (18:00):</b><br>Of space?</p><p><b>Tom (18:01):</b><br>Space. And so, particularly suburban real estate is kind of on fire right now. Particularly suburban open air. </p><p><b>Joe (18:08):</b><br>Why?</p><p><b>Tom (18:09):</b><br>Well, first and foremost, think about what happened in the pandemic. So many people moved back to the suburbs. And they're working from home. They're not necessarily coming into Midtown Manhattan every day. So they have a lot more time. And so they're using those local retail outlets. Retailers are using their stores for multiple purposes, like fulfilling online orders. And so you see this whole synergy between the physical and digital world.</p><p>And so while you have this increasing demand for space, because of these multiple purposes, you have really had almost no new supply – net new supply. There's individual markets where there's been retail construction. But if you look broadly over the United States, retail sales, since the great financial crisis, have almost doubled. 85, 86% increase since that period of time. US GDP has gone up by 30%. Population's gone up by almost 10%. Retail square footage has gone up almost nothing during that period of time.</p><p>So the industry has done a very good job of growing out of the financial crisis, but has not built a whole lot of new supply. And quite frankly, there's probably not a lot of new supply that's going to be built over the course of the next couple of years. One, it takes a long time. Even if you could start today and say ‘I'm going to commit to build a whole lot of new retail square footage,’ it would take a number of years for that to come on site. And of course, the cost of capital has increased significantly over the course of the last months.</p><p><b>Joe (19:36):</b><br>Once again, we see how higher rates actually impair the supply side, in this case, retail real estate.</p><p><b>Tom (19:42):</b><br>So occupancy, particularly in the open air space, is at historical highs. Vacancies are exceptionally low. And when you hear of these large retailers that have filed for bankruptcy and they’re closing locations, like at Bed Bath & Beyond and so forth, there's typically multiple bidders for that space. Almost on the day it becomes available, because it's well located, and because there's this demand for physical space. And whether it's filled by one retailer or multiple, the owner-developer may reconfigure the space if they have multiple possible tenants for it. </p><p><b>Tracy (20:17):</b><br>I feel like we need a moment of silence for Bed Bath & Beyond, the place where I think probably 80% of people in America have bought the essentials for their first apartment or house. Tom, you mentioned the space restrictions there. How much of that is the higher cost of funding, the PTSD from the pandemic, versus people writing off physical retail for years now? I mean, this was a story even in the early to mid 2010s, the idea that, well, people just aren't going to go to shopping malls. Everything's going to be superseded by online shopping.</p><p><b>Tom (20:55):</b><br>Well, the biggest factor in the challenge around supply is just the lack of construction. And the lack of construction really was, I think, a byproduct of the great financial crisis, owner-developers being resistant to building having gone through that, obviously lenders being resistant to the construction of new retail space during that period of time.</p><p>So I think the market kind of dictated that we had enough retail square footage, and we're not going to build a whole lot more, unless you're building new housing developments and so forth, in growing parts of the United States, obviously there's been a lot of new retail in Texas and Florida, and places where the market's growing.</p><p>So to that extent, the narrative around the demise of physical retail influenced how much construction there was over the last 15 years. Today, I think if you talk to most people in the space, and most people that are investors in the space, or possible sources of capital, commercial retail real estate is actually a fairly favorite sector right now. Which is historically where it's always been except for the last 15 years ago. Because it emerged from the pandemic in such a strong position.</p><p><b>Tracy (22:03):</b><br>It's also on a relative basis to office space, right?</p><p><b>Tom (22:07):</b><br>I mean, there's logistics, industrial, healthcare. There's lots of different types of commercial real estate. So I think it's gone back to a space where people view it in a favored way. It's stable – statistics and data around it, back to the supply and demand, are such that it suggests that there's a stability around it. And there's a unlikelihood that you're going to have a whole bunch of new supply coming on the market anytime soon.</p><p>So I think most investors look at retail real estate quite favorably right now. Clearly there's some challenges in the space. I mean, there are centers that haven't done as well, but that's just competition. And the mall sector, there are exceptionally well-performing malls, particularly in the high end sector. There are some challenge malls, but the mall sector gets such a disproportionate amount of attention. There's over a hundred thousand shopping centers in the United States. About a thousand of them are malls. But because they're so iconic and they take up a lot of square footage, they do get a lot of attention. But all malls aren't created equal. And some are doing exceptionally well, and some are more challenged.</p><p><b>Joe (23:16):</b><br>Are there cursed locations? Because you always, you know, you drive through your town and the new restaurant or something is there, it's like, oh, it's the fifth one in that spot, and you think, this must be a cursed spot.</p><p><b>Tracy (23:29):</b><br>Or even in New York, there's real estate that stays empty for years and you think, what's going on there?</p><p><b>Joe (23:35):</b><br>And like A) is that a real phenomenon or is that just something we create in our brains? But then the other question is if I have a store and I'm looking, would I get unnerved? It's like, man, the last five tenants in this location, they each only lasted 18 months. It looks good on paper, but for some reason whoever occupies this space — like, is that a real phenomenon? And is that something that a prospective tenant would take into account? </p><p><b>Tom (23:58):</b><br>Well, it's certainly something a prospective tenant <b>should </b>take into account. You should look at the location and say, what's the history of somebody that's been in that location? And if you have a series of failed tenants in a location, it may be because they had a bad concept. Or it may be the location has something to do with it, so you should clearly look at it. And sometimes it's as simple as is it a right turn or a left turn? What’s the traffic flow? And that does matter. Look, time's limited, there's stress for time. If you have a young family and you have to wait five minutes to make a left, well.</p><p><b>Joe (24:28):</b><br>I drive with my family and that is a big factor. It's like, oh, it's on the other side of the road.</p><p><b>Tracy (24:32):</b><br>Wait, you can only turn left?</p><p><b>Joe (24:34):</b><br>No, it's just more like you're thinking about where to stop on a drive. And you're like ‘Oh, do I really want to have to do a left turn in, or a left turn out? Maybe I'll go to the one where, you know.’</p><p><b>Tom (24:45):</b><br>Those things matter. Absolutely. So, I do think prospective tenants should look at the history of who's in a space. Generally, if it's a, quote, ‘cursed location,’ honestly it has to do more with, take a step back and look at the location or that shopping center. It probably is one that either there's a really strong center right next door to it, and that strong center and or the one that's, quote ‘cursed,’ just isn't getting the kind of care and attention and investment that is needed.</p><p>People want to shop someplace where it's clean and it's well kept and it's well maintained and they want to shop where quite frankly, while we all don't like crowds, we kind of like crowds, because if there's a crowd there that attracts us to go there, there must be something to it. So often it has to do with investment and just care and feeding of the center. </p><p><b>Joe (25:34):</b><br>Tom, that was great.</p><p><b>Tracy (25:34):</b><br>Tom, thank you so much. That was fantastic.</p><p><b>Tom (25:36):</b><br>I hope I gave you what you're looking for. </p><p><b>Joe (25:37):</b><br>That was really fun. That was our conversation with Tom McGee, CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers. And now, let's talk to Chris Hatch of Forza Development, on the art of drive-thru site selection.</p><p><b>Joe: (25:50)</b><br>What does Forza Development do?</p><p><b>Chris Hatch (25:52):</b><br>We are a retail developer and we're based out of Salt Lake City, and we build retail throughout the United States.</p><p><b>Tracy (25:58):</b><br>What kind of retail? Any specific names?</p><p><b>Chris (26:00):</b><br>Currently we're doing a lot of work for Dutch Bros throughout their expansion. And then we are also doing some Starbucks, and have an In-N-Out deal going, Jack in the Box, etc.</p><p><b>Joe (26:11):</b><br>So are you a domain expert for drive-thru type concepts of coffee shops and restaurants?</p><p><b>Chris (26:19):</b><br>If you really like to nerd out and think through throughput through a drive-thru, then I am your person, yes.</p><p><b>Joe (26:24):</b><br>I have a feeling that <b>Odd Lots</b> listeners are really into the idea of nerding out on drive-thru throughput. </p><p><b>Tracy (26:31):</b><br>Wait, so are there specific considerations for a drive-thru though? Because when I think about a Starbucks, primarily, I mean this may be an offshoot of living in large cities for a long time, but I primarily think of walking into a Starbucks, ordering my coffee, and then probably not staying there, but walking out.</p><p><b>Joe (26:49):</b><br>This shows how out of touch city dwellers are that we mostly associate Starbucks with a place you walk into. </p><p><b>Tracy (26:55):</b><br>But they have both. I mean, even in the suburbs there's both. So when you're thinking about developing a site, are you thinking specifically about the drive-thru potential or about the retail opportunity, overall?</p><p><b>Chris (27:06):</b><br>Yeah, that's an excellent question. And I would say either you're out of touch or that's the magic and charm of living in a city life. So as far as a Dutch Bros goes, a Dutch Bros is a 950 square foot building. The vast majority, in fact, with the exception of only maybe a few units, have no interior seating, there's no interior dining. Sometimes they'll have a patio, and a walk-up counter is typical for walk-up pedestrian traffic. However, 95% plus of their drive-thru traffic is their customer pattern.</p><p><b>Joe (27:37):</b><br>What about like for a Starbucks? So you said you've done Starbucks as well, and I know that the drive-thru pickup, etc., I think that's like a booming part of their business overall. But how do you think about, say, balancing that – I was actually just at a Starbucks that had both a drive-thru and a walk-in. So how would a Starbucks or you think about balancing those two different modes?</p><p><b>Chris (28:00):</b><br>So I'm currently building my 9th and 10th Starbucks that I've developed for them. We have done one of those as a drive-thru only concept, which is sort of similar to that Dutch Bros footprint, about 950 square feet, no interior dining and has a pedestrian walk-up window. The other nine have all been cafe stores and the average size of those have been about 2,400 square feet. It typically allows for about 80 customers to sit down inside of the restaurant or Starbucks cafe, and then the rest of the traffic go through the drive-thru. I think they're typically experiencing about 50% of their traffic and sales going through the drive-thru. So massively important for them.</p><p><b>Tracy (28:34):</b><br>Okay. Here's another step back question. What is the allure of the drive-thru? I don't get it because I do see – okay, not in New York. When I'm in Connecticut, there is a local coffee shop that I go to and it has a drive-thru window and there is, every morning, an incredibly long line, and I will still get out of the car, go into the store, order the coffee there, take it into the car and avoid the drive-thru.</p><p><b>Joe (28:58):</b><br>Tracy, can I answer this? You don't have kids to get out of car seats, and buckle them back up. </p><p><b>Tracy (29:03):</b><br>Maybe that's it.</p><p><b>Joe (29:04):</b><br>Well, I'll let Chris answer, but my first impulse is like, I can tell you exactly why I don't want to get out of a car sometimes. </p><p><b>Chris (29:11):</b><br>Yeah, you bet. You were asking me about the weather when I sat down and I was telling you how Salt Lake is in a little bit of a warm front right now, which is high-thirties and mid-thirties for this time of year. But imagine, for example, you're my wife – we have five kids. 15 to six years old, and you've got multiple kids buckled into seat belts and you're come from a dance or ice skating or soccer or whatever the current exact activity is at this moment, you're just trying to hydrate yourself and the kids. It is just so much more convenient to go through the drive-thru.</p><p>Now what's wild about that is if you have the time and energy and desire, it's so much faster typically to walk into the restaurant. And especially on these coffee things, most of these retailers have become very smart with tech. And so you can typically make an order in advance. It'll be prepared and ready and sitting for you. So you just walk in, grab it and walk out.</p><p><b>Joe (30:02):</b><br>Buckling and unbuckling car seats in particular is just like one of those things where it's not that hard and it doesn't take time, but there is this mental element. It's like ‘Oh man, who's going to do the buckling?’ And so I don't mind spending several minutes in the theoretical drive-thru to avoid the 15 seconds of the unbuckling and buckling process.</p><p>Let's get into site selection. So whether it's a Dutch Bros or a Starbucks, you want to find the optimal place for that person to come in, swing their car in, stand the line. What are the first things that a site location must have to make it a plausible drive-thru location?</p><p><b>Chris (30:42):</b><br>For this I might switch brands. Let's flip over to In-N-Out Burger for a moment. So I'm working on my first In-N-Out Burger location and it's actually located in the city of South Salt Lake City, not Salt Lake City. Now, the reason I bring that up is the very first thing you need to pay attention to when you're selecting a site is you've got a good corner. It's got good presence on the street, it's got excellent ingress so you can get into the site very easily with a vehicle, which is how most of the traffic is driven to these types of concepts.</p><p>Then your next step is to determine if it actually is large enough and if your targeted client can fit and operate and run their mouse trap on the site. And then the second part of that is to make sure from a city perspective, that you actually have zoning in place, and you have support from the local municipality that you can put in a drive-thru that's going to create the kind of traffic and trip generation that one of these typical users is going to create.</p><p>So the reason this is a good example is originally In-N-Out was actually trying to locate in Salt Lake City. So they have rolled out just under a dozen restaurants in the state of Utah, but they've actually never entered the capital city of Salt Lake City. And part of the reason they've never done that is because there are a number of different zoning regulations that make it quite preventative to build new retail in Salt Lake City. And because of that, they've just never been able to get in. So there was a closed Burger King and then a burned down Sconecutter, which is a scone drive-thru business, which has kind of gone out.</p><p><b>Tracy (32:04):</b><br>Sconecutter? That's a great name. I love that.</p><p><b>Chris (32:08):</b><br>It's too bad it's gone by the wayside a little bit here. But so there was a burnt down restaurant and then there was a former Burger King that wasn't doing very much volume, maybe a million or a million and two or something. And In-N-Out wanted to come in and place their unit there. And Salt Lake City would not allow them to place a prototype unit unless they had a maximum of five parking stalls.</p><p>I don't know if you've been to an In-N-Out Burger, but they need more than five parking stalls. So that was a real problem. So it hit a stalemate and what ended up happening is Jack in the Box actually opened in the Burger King, instead of In-N-Out. And so In-N-Out came across the street to my site, which is located in South Salt Lake City, where our city had open arms as a municipality to welcome them in.</p><p><b>Tracy (33:04):</b><br>How much do safety considerations go into site selection for a drive-thru? Because I imagine a normal shop front, you just plonk it down in the correct zone and there's probably not that many problems that are going to emerge. But in something like a drive-thru, you do have things that happen, where for instance, if it gets too crowded you start to have cars sort of coming out of the space and maybe disrupting traffic and things like that. How does that factor into it?</p><p><b>Chris (33:31):</b><br>Tracy, it's a good question. I get asked that question so frequently and it comes from a wide variety of people asking that question. Most of the brands that we work with are national retailers. They're household names. You typically can recognize them as they're rolling off my lips.</p><p>And the vast majority of them do a lot of homework on these sites. And that includes engaging a traffic engineer, that includes engaging a very talented civil engineer, and a lot of time is spent figuring out what the traffic demand is going to look like, what the trip count is going to look like, and then making sure that humans and vehicles are moving in and out of the site in a safe manner, and that it is also very efficient. And then also taking into concern how the pedestrians are coming on and off of site and how bicyclists are coming on and off of site.</p><p>I would contend, more attention is paid to how to work some of those issues out than you may think. Now that isn't saying that it always works out flawlessly, because as soon as I say that somebody could point out 10 examples that they've driven by where it is not efficient and it does not work well. And it does happen frequently. This is unfortunate. We try to spend a lot of our time at Forza making sure we have a very efficient site plan so that we are maximizing the real estate that we have, and maximizing how to get customers on and off the site.</p><p><b>Joe (34:47):</b><br>Stepping back for a second, normally when you hear about zoning issues, I feel like local planners are talking about minimum parking requirements. They're like ‘Okay, if you're going to build something here, you have to provide a minimum amount of parking.’ I know there's a lot of fights about this, but the issue at Salt Lake City was a maximum parking situation? They couldn't have more than five places? Why was that? And what are the sort of like other zoning, what are some general zoning questions that come up for the drive-thru concepts?</p><p><b>Chris (35:16):</b><br>Yeah, there's a lot of wonderful markets throughout the Western US and it certainly gets more challenging as you get closer to the water. But there's a number of California coastal communities that could definitely benefit from having a Chick-fil-A or somebody else like that. Or even take one in my backyard, which is Park City. I'm sure In-N-Out or Chick-fil-A would love to land right in the middle of Park City.</p><p>However, the county has no desire to really approve a drive-thru use at that intersection. And so sometimes it's just, for whatever reason, certain councils feel a certain way about things. And even though it is definitely a continued trend in America and has only been increasing over the last 20 to 30 years, not decreasing, it doesn't seem to really alter the way some of these councils are wired.</p><p>Sometimes they just don't want drive-thrus. In the case of Salt Lake City, that was a little bit unique there. Salt Lake is really pushing for more vertical growth than anything else. And one of the ways that they're pushing for more vertical growth is by restricting open parking lots. They do not want an open unstructured parking lot. And so part of what they're doing is pushing people to build structured parking. And that can work, but some retailers, they simply will not deal with a mixed use scenario and it's just not the way their mousetrap works. And if they can't expand to Salt Lake City, then they'll go on and build another one in Dallas, or wherever else they can get the zoning. </p><p><b>Tracy (36:39):</b><br>What does creativity look like in your business? And the reason I ask is because I can imagine – Joe and I are in journalism, and being creative in journalism is maybe you write something in a very innovative way or you present information in a new way or you find a new way of telling a story. But in site selection, what would be a creative choice when it comes to choosing a retail location?</p><p><b>Chris (37:05):</b><br>Sometimes it's just figuring out what would actually work for a development opportunity. There are a lot of corridors that are mature and they're built out and they're an established retail trade area. And we might have two or three tenants that would like to locate in that trade area. And there is no land, there's not an easy, no-brainer, piece of land sitting in front of a Walmart or Kroger.</p><p>And so sometimes the creativity is just trying to figure out where we could actually land the retailer. Is there a former Taco John’s, or Subway, or something else that's run down that we need to go call the owner of the property and say ‘Hey, this is kind of run down. How are rental payments coming in? Are you getting regular rent?’ So we spend a lot of our time working on lower-performing restaurant locations that already have a drive-thru use, and sometimes already have a building, which in today's world, that is much cheaper if it's got a building, most of the time, especially if we can repurpose the building.</p><p><b>Joe (38:06):</b><br>Big box retailers like a Walmart or a Costco, etc., how much of when they think, it’s like, okay, we all have an idea in our mind of what those look like. In the back there's a big building and then there's seemingly sometimes acres of parking. How often do they think about do we want to allocate some of this stuff in the middle of this parking lot to a drive-thru, versus just having that be more parking?</p><p><b>Chris (38:31):</b><br>If it's in advance, then it's very intentional. And for a long time when Walmart was on their big US growth spree, which was really kind of 2000 to about 2017, 2018, as they were growing, they were typically going in and they would put in as many outparcels as they could fit onto a parcel. So for example a 200,000 foot Walmart's typically going to need about 20 to 22 acres to fit on and have enough parking for its own needs, in its opinion.</p><p>And then if they could buy another 10 acres that had pad frontage, then they would go buy another 10 acres. And more or less what would happen is they might've bought the entire site at $7 to $10 per square foot, and then they turn around and they charge people like me $20 to $30 per square foot to buy one of the outparcels. And it wasn't uncommon for them to write their basis and their land down by maybe a third or half of what they might've paid for it originally. And so it really is a nice robust business plan for them.</p><p>Now if it's an afterthought and you're going in on an existing store and you're saying ‘Hey look, this area of the parking field really is not that well utilized,’ that sounds really good if you're sitting in a boardroom in Bentonville, Arkansas and you're sitting around trying to tell your asset management boss ‘Hey, I'm figuring out a way to drive more revenue.’</p><p>In reality, it's a nightmare. You have to get through operations, there's just so many layers and there's so much corporate bureaucracy and it's not the way that the retailers are really geared to figure out how to make money out of existing real estate. And so it becomes very challenging to get through that process. We've looked at a number of those. We have done a few of them, but I would tell you that you probably work three times as hard on the site selection side, as a normal piece of land.</p><p><b>Tracy (40:13):</b><br>Can shopping malls be converted into drive-thru centers? Like if you have a bunch of dead shopping malls in the country, could we just get rid of the mall and create, I don't know, two McDonald's and five Starbucks and three Taco Bells?</p><p><b>Chris (40:28):</b><br>It's a great idea. A lot of them even have periphery retail sitting around them now. What you're watching right now is most of these mall REITs have been off on earnings for a couple of years here. And so you're starting to watch a lot of these mall REITs list some of their assets for sale. Sometimes that's the entire mall. Sometimes that's just the outparcels. But it is definitely a way in which the REITs are looking at this saying ‘We would like to create value.’</p><p>You have two challenges when it comes to those. Typically, the first challenge is what kind of redevelopment rights or what kind of development rights do the anchor tenants have over the pads, in other words, can a Dillard’s or can a Saks dictate ‘Hey, a building cannot be more than 28 feet in height with parapet walls and all the architectural features?’ Or can a building even be built there at all? And so they may just have their handout to get paid. It may take a year to get that approval. So that's kind of involved.</p><p>The second part of that just has to do with mall maintenance, running the property long term, and then how that is untied to the outparcel. Sometimes figuring out how to untie the expenses becomes so problematic that the companies don't move forward.</p><p><b>Tracy (41:37):</b><br>It'd be funny, I was just thinking, if we converted all the dead malls into massive drive-thrus and then at some point all the drive-thrus decide we should just put a roof over the top of all our stores to make it more convenient for people. And then we're just back where we started.</p><p><b>Joe (41:52):</b><br>A gigantic food court. Let's talk about another thing that's come up in this conversation about site selection, and that is proximity or lack of proximity to competitors. And, well, I mean it's funny because at least for a time, I think they've thinned them out a little bit, you know, like in New York City, you could be sitting in a Starbucks and see another Starbucks. I think they’ve gotten rid of some [of them], that's gotten rare. But whether it's proximity to an existing location, or a close competitor, or a modest competitor, how does that go into site selection?</p><p><b>Chris (42:27):</b><br>Yeah, it just goes into the model. So a retailer will typically have some kind of sales forecast as they show up and look at a new site. There are a number of different factors that go into what that model looks like, and what the output comes back as an estimated first year sales volume. And then typically a two- or three- or four-year stabilized sales volume.</p><p>Some industries have got this pinned down much tighter than others. For example, if you're looking at a grocery store location, the grocery casing analysts are very dialed in. They typically can figure out within a very tight degree of accuracy what a grocery store is going to do in its first full year of volume. </p><p>So there's only so many sales dollars in any given trade area. The easiest way is to think of it as any ring city. So take like Dallas Fort Worth, for example, or even just Dallas, you have a ring around it and then there's no geographical obstruction. So just put say a one mile or two mile or three mile ring around the center point, being the site. And then basically you have to figure out how many of the customers that exist in there would normally be a shopper for that concept.</p><p>And then number two, how many of those can then shop at a competitor where you might lose those sales. And so once you kind of boil it in, all of that goes into coming up with an estimated sales volume for the retailer. And more or less, that's where our world lives. The higher the sales volume for the retailer, the more they can pay in rent. And so there's a direct correlation there. There's an occupancy cost that each retailer can afford as a percentage of their gross sales, how much they can pay in total operating expense.</p><p><b>Joe (43:58):</b><br>So in a given trade area, would the analyst or the company or the modeler come up with a total annual dollar volume that people in this area might be expected to pay for takeout coffee in a year? </p><p><b>Chris (44:11)</b><br>Yes. </p><p><b>Joe (44:12):</b><br>So you come up with that number first? </p><p><b>Chris (44:14):</b><br>Yes. They do.</p><p><b>Joe (44:15):</b><br>The retailers do. But then like, in terms of, well, how far away do I want to be from a, let's say, Jack in the Box versus In-N-Out, which are kind of substitutes – they're not exactly the same thing, but one might choose one over the other on a given day. How far would a Jack in the Box want to be from the nearest In-N-Out?</p><p><b>Chris (44:35):</b><br>That's actually a great example. A Jack in the Box can probably live with a mile and a quarter to two mile spacing.</p><p><b>Joe (44:40):</b><br>How do you come up with that number? Talk to us about that.</p><p><b>Chris (44:43):</b><br>Well, in part it's, if you look at their average annual volume, I forget offhand, but if you check <b>Quick Service Restaurant</b>, which is typically the periodical to go to for these kinds of sales, I think they're at 1.4, 1.5, national average, million per year. In-N-Out does not release numbers, but they're widely thought to have a number over 10 million per year per unit. And so almost 10 times. Typically their draw is more like a three to six mile draw, and a Jack in the box is more like a one to two mile draw. Chick-Fil-A has a wider draw than Wendy's. </p><p><b>Joe (45:16):</b><br>That makes sense.</p><p><b>Chris (45:18):</b><br>You do have to think of this in terms of suburbia though, back to the soccer mom driving Suburbans. </p><p><b>Tracy (45:25):</b><br>On that note, I have a sort of technical drive-thru specific question. How much do acoustics factor into site selection? Because things have changed a lot over the years. I think the audio technology that people are using to communicate at the drive-thru is vastly improved. Most people nowadays are probably ordering on an app anyway. But one of the big frustrations of prior years has to be if you pull up to a McDonald's on the side of a highway, and you're trying to communicate with the person inside and you're yelling at them that you want a quarter pounder with cheese and they just cannot hear you at all. Is that a factor at all anymore? Or has that mostly been improved through tech?</p><p><b>Chris (46:05):</b><br>It has been improved, however, the amount of customers going through the drive-thru has increased. So I think in some of those cases where you have old equipment that has not been reinvested into, it for sure is still a problem on a lot of these units. Some of the newer concepts have definitely made some massive advances in that. And then you have other groups, like to go back to Dutch Bros, for example, they don't have a squawk box. There is no ordering system. It's a human that takes your order in the parking lot.</p><p><b>Tracy (46:32):</b><br>Wait, do they actually call it a squawk box, like in finance? That's so funny.</p><p><b>Chris (46:35):</b><br>Yes. The head of real estate does. So they take your order on an iPad and it's a human that takes your order. There are massive advantages to ordering through their app, for example. And then there's a whole slew of other restaurants that are more of like a pickup service. So it's meal pickup, back to the point of saving time and not undoing buckles, Joe. So think of that as a typical restaurant that you would normally never really go into. Like even a Panera, you call ahead, and then as you queue into the drive-thru, you hit on the app, I'm here. And then they run an order that's already kind of pre-ordered, pre-put together, out to your car.</p><p><b>Joe (47:13):</b><br>Another factor that came up, and I'm thinking again to a recent time I went to a Starbucks in my car – minimization of left turns, or other situations in which you're going to have a longer wait. Or it's like ‘Oh, when I get back on the street, am I going to have to take a left turn out? And is there a light?’</p><p>Talk to us about traffic patterns around the location. And I imagine it might be different for a sort of Starbucks, which I imagine is busier in the morning and in one direction of the commute versus maybe a, you know, In-N-Out, which you might get on the way home or something like that. And maybe you're on the other side of the street. Talk to us about traffic and turn minimization and whatever else comes into play there.</p><p><b>Chris (47:53):</b><br>In regards to traffic, I've probably spent more time in my life behind a windshield sitting at a corner, counting cars, than I would like to admit.</p><p><b>Joe (48:01):</b><br>Say more.</p><p><b>Chris (48:02):</b><br>It's pretty easy to find where the strong a.m. traffic pattern is versus p.m. You sit at an intersection and you watch traffic and you do that from like 8 to 10 a.m. or you do that at 4 to 5 p.m. and then the inverse logic is there. So if it's heavier at 4 or 5 p.m., you know that the other side of the road is heavier in the morning. That's the easiest way to find – at any coffee site — is to sit at an intersection and count cars if you're unfamiliar with that trade area.</p><p>With regard to getting ingress and egress on and off the site, most of these retailers are going to care about ingress most. Probably 80% of their weight is worried about how does a car get in? You rarely want somebody to be making a left in unless it's a very safe left in at a traffic signal – a dedicated left in, you see those sometimes with like the raised medians. But a right in and right out is so preferred. And if you're sitting at an intersection where you can get a right in, right out on one side of the site, and a full movement on the other side. That's the ideal.</p><p><b>Joe (48:59):</b><br>Chris Hatch, thank you so much for coming on <b>Odd Lots</b>. Now I feel like we have to talk to a traffic engineer, and zoners, and...</p><p><b>Tracy (49:07):</b><br>A soccer mom going to Starbucks?</p><p><b>Joe (49:09):</b><br>Yeah. That was really fun. Thank you so much. </p><p><b>Chris (49:12):</b><br>Thanks for having me. It gave me an excuse to get steak frites in the city.</p><p><b>Joe (49:15):</b><br>Perfect. Tracy, I loved this whole conversation. I'm trying to think where to begin. Okay, location matters, we all know that. But then you think, all these different types of retail concepts and the sort of specific things that matter to them, whether it's like what side of the road you're on, or who are the other entities, or are you in some other company's parking lot? I just feel like there's an endless amount to learn in this area.</p><p><b>Tracy (49:56):</b><br>Totally. I also thought that the sort of evolution of what you're looking for with a physical space is also interesting. I think Tom touched on this idea that, okay, post-pandemic, things started to shift. It was much more of an almost warehouse effect, or you know, you order something online and then you pick it up, which means that the demand for locations that are on the outer fringes of shopping malls and are easily accessible, become even more important.</p><p><b>Joe (50:25):</b><br>Totally. It's also just sort of fascinating that like, as Tom was saying, the demand for space, according, to him is still enormous. Which is really interesting. And you know, we talk a lot about, again, CRE office, right? And okay, we all know that that's troubled, but the fact that there's all this other kind of CRE and some of it is absolutely booming.</p><p><b>Tracy (50:45):</b><br>Absolutely. And there is that sort of bifurcation or segmentation in the market as well. Were you convinced at all to get out of the car to get your coffee, to avoid the drive-thru, or not? Are you even more dedicated to the coffee drive-thru now?</p><p><b>Joe (50:59):</b><br>No, I mean, actually, so the most recent time I went to a Starbucks, I did get out of the car. It really is conditional. Like, part of it is the weather. Part of it is how annoying my kids are being at any given time. These are like the big factors that go in and, I swear, do I have to take a left turn to get in? This is like a big deal. I know it sounds silly, but...</p><p><b>Tracy (51:24):</b><br>Now we should all feel better knowing that there are people out there who are taking this stuff into consideration. </p><p><b>Joe (51:30):</b><br>Yeah, right. Like, as Chris was saying, that he would sit there at a corner and just count the number of cars making various turns from 8 to 10 and then come back from 4 to 6 or whatever, and count again, is totally fascinating to me.</p><p><b>Tracy (51:43):</b><br>Yep. Shall we leave it there for now? </p><p><b>Joe (51:45):</b><br>Let's leave it there. </p><p>  <br><b>You can follow Tom McGee at </b><br><a href=https://twitter.com/TomMcGeeCEO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor><br><b> </b><br><b>@TomMcGeeCEO</b><br></a><br><b> and Chris Hatch at </b><br><a href=https://twitter.com/NNNIncome><br><b> </b><br><b>@NNNIncome</b><br></a><br><b>.</b><br></p></body></body></html>
