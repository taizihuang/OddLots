        <h2>Something Just Flipped in the Credit Market for the First Time Since 2020</h2>
    <p>Watch out for those falling angels!</p><p>While the big story in credit markets has been <a href=bbg://news/stories/S832UIT0AFB4>booming sales of new debt</a>, ultra-low credit spreads and resilient corporate balance sheets as recognized by the billions of dollars worth of bonds being <a href=bbg://news/stories/S1AF9RDWRGG0>upgraded by rating agencies</a>, the trend may be fading.</p><p>The proportion of BBB-rated bonds — those at the lowest tier of investment-grade — that are now on watch for a downgrade has recently surpassed the proportion of debt on watch for upgrades for the first time since early 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. </p><p>While “credit fundamentals are generally strong and ratings momentum is positive, the risk of downgrades to high-yield has increased recently,” say Bank of America analysts led by Yuri Seliger. “Moreover, some of the capital structures potentially at risk of a downgrade are large.”</p><p>Analysts have for years <a href=https://www.mauldineconomics.com/editorial/the-corporate-debt-bubble-is-strikingly-similar-to-the-subprime-mortgage-bu>been warning</a> of a ‘Triple B bubble, or the idea that a swelling amount of investment-grade debt is at risk of being downgraded into junk, or transforming into proverbial “fallen angels” in market parlance.</p><p>So far, that’s failed to materialize and 2023 instead market one of the slowest years for fallen angels on record, with just $19.1 billion of US debt dropping from investment-grade to high-yield status, according to CreditSights Inc. data. <br>Billions of dollars worth of debt sold by BBB-rated companies has instead been <b>upgraded </b>in recent months as companies continued to shore up their balance sheets. And so great has been the surge in upgrades that some analysts <a href=bbg://news/stories/S1AF9RDWRGG0>have argued</a> that it’s helping to keep spreads, or risk premiums, on corporate debt low despite the highest benchmark interest rates in decades.</p><p>Complicating matters now, however, is the number of large issuers of debt potentially facing downgrades. These include Charter Communications Inc. with $45.1 billion in bonds outstanding and Paramount Global with $13 billion.</p><p>Even Boeing Inc., once a stalwart of US industrial policy, is at risk after both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s recently moved the company to a negative outlook. The aerospace giant has some $45.8 billion of debt outstanding, though it was recently able to <a href=bbg://news/stories/SCQ42GT0G1KW>sell $10 billion worth of new bonds</a>, rated BBB-, with relative ease.</p><p>“In a potential event of a downgrade to high-yield, Boeing and Charter would rank as [the] fifth and seventh largest fallen angels on record as a share of the BB index,” the Bank of America analysts said.</p><p><b>Related link:</b><br><a href=bbg://news/stories/S1AF9RDWRGG0>Is This The Beginning of the Bursting of the BBB Bubble?</a> — <b>Odd Lots</b></p></body></body></html>
